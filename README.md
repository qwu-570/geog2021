GEOG2021 Environmental Remote Sensing
========

EDUCATIONAL AIMS AND OBJECTIVES

To enable the students to:
Understand the nature of remote sensing data and how they are acquired
Understand different types of remote sensing instruments and their missions
Understand basic image representation and processing
Understand how Earth Observation data can be combined with other sources of data and data techniques (e.g. GIS)
Understand how EO data can be used in environmental science (particularly via classification and monitoring)
Develop practical skills in these areas, which may be useful in planning of dissertations
Develop links with the second year course on Geographic Information Systems Science and with othet courses as appropriate (e.g. hydrology, environmental systems)
Lay the foundations for the third year course on Earth Observation
There are no prerequisites for this course, but GEOG2021 will form the usual requirement for those wishing to take GEOG3051 and 3052.
